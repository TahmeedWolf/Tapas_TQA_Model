--------------------   PRO   ------------------------

TAPAS (and similar table QA models) are great at:


Answering simple, fact-based questions (e.g. "What is Lex's department?")

Summarizing columns or extracting direct matches


--------------------   CON   ------------------------

But they struggle badly with:


Comparisons ("Who earns more than X?")

Sorting/ranking ("Top 5 earners?")

Aggregations ("Average salary in Sales?")

Logic-based queries ("List all employees older than 30 in HR")
